## ⚡ What is OCCUPRA?

Students waste hours physically checking libraries, computer labs, classrooms, and study rooms to find quiet spaces. During peak hours, facilities become overcrowded while others sit underutilized.

**OCCUPRA** is a futuristic **Smart Campus Digital Twin & IoT Command Center** that brings real-time visibility, ML predictive forecasting, and intelligent resource recommendations to campus facilities.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 👨‍🎓 Student Experience
1. **Interactive Digital Twin Map**: Leaflet.js campus map with color-coded markers (Quiet 🟢, Moderate 🟡, Crowded 🔴) across 15 campus locations.
2. **Live Crowd Heatmap**: Real-time visual density heatmap displaying live occupancy across all campus zones.
3. **AI Crowd Prediction**: Multi-horizon forecasting (+30 min, +1 hr, +2 hr, +4 hr) powered by Gradient Boosting Regressor ML models trained on historical campus trends.
4. **Smart Resource Finder**: Match-scoring wizard that recommends the optimal study/lab space based on your required seats, max crowd tolerance, and walking distance.
5. **One-Tap Space Booking**: Reserve available seats with real-time confirmation codes and cancellation management.
6. **Smart Alerts**: Live notifications for peak surges, quiet space availability, and upcoming reservations.

### 🛡️ Admin Command Center
1. **Live Campus Monitoring**: Real-time digital twin monitoring of all 15 resources.
2. **IoT Sensor Control Center**: Live entry/exit sensor rates, simulate manual entries/exits, pause/resume sensors, and track hardware health.
3. **Demo Simulation Engine**: Adjustable speed (Slow / Normal / Fast), one-click **Demo Surge Trigger**, and state reset for hackathon demos.
4. **Crowd & Utilization Analytics**: Hourly occupancy area charts, weekly day-by-day distribution, peak activity windows, and category-level utilization.
5. **AI Campus Insights**: Automated anomaly detection, peak warnings, and optimization insights.
6. **Resource Management**: Full CRUD management of campus facilities.
